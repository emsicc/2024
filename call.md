# Call for Papers

This workshop is intended to provide a forum for discussing a wide range of problems related to energy-aware, energy-efficient management solutions for designing distributed computing platforms (software and hardware) for the IoT, Cyber-physical and Cloud Computing systems.

Prospective authors are invited to submit original, previously unpublished work, reporting on novel and significant research contributions, on-going research projects, experimental results and recent developments related to, but not limited to, the following topics:

- Energy-aware/energy harvesting scheduling algorithms using intelligence
- Adaptive middleware for energy-efficient computing
- Instrumentation and measurement of energy-efficient computing and networking
- Enhanced performance and QoS in energy-efficient systems
- Resource management in large infrastructures (such as data centres) and in power/energy constrained systems
- Data management in energy-efficient systems
- Sensing, monitoring, control, and management of energy systems
- Modelling, control, and architectures for renewable energy generation resources
- Privacy and security in energy-aware platforms
- Metrics, benchmarks, interfaces, and tools to consider energy dimension
- Energy-aware hardware platforms
- Specifications and validation of energy-aware platforms
- Energy efficiency and virtualization in Cloud of Things
- Energy services for smart cities
- Intelligent optimisation and computational intelligence for IoT devices
- Machine learning approaches for energy management
- Learning of patterns of energy deployment in smart applications
- Prediction of anticipated energy consumption.
